# Clean Code Principles

## Naming
- Use meaningful, descriptive names
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood
- Use consistent naming conventions

## Functions
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Limit function parameters (max 3-4)
- Avoid side effects where possible
